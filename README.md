## About Iron Maiden

### Project Background ###

The aim was to find a real world client to represent and present a web application for a final assessment. A minimum of MVP required us to build a working prototype of the client concept and print it to a working deployed URL. Front-end deployed through Netlify and back-end deployed through Ziet Now.

Essentially, we needed to find a find an issue with our client's service and find a solution. Considering it had not yet been given a website, our solution was to create the website from scratch. This implements a user login system that uses a boolean (true or false) to determin whether the user was an Admin or normal user. This led into a a user profile that allowed them to place orders for their laundry.

### Functionality, Features and About ###
Iron Maiden is a business that works in favour with the trend of the lazy world. As we indulged in the constant service of UberEats and Airtasker, people like me look towards applications to take care of other issues that my laziness intends to repent. 

With the simplicity of Iron Maiden, your laundry will simply be picked up from your address in Prahan or Richmond and delivered back to you after two days.\
i.e Richmind, pickup Monday and dropoff Wednesday.

##Short Answer Questions

1) What are the most important aspects of quality software?


2) What libraries are being used in the app and why?
Many libraries are involved in the creation of this app including React, Node.js, axios, react-router-dom and mongoose.

React
React may be seen as a framework rather than a library, however many have argued that it is qualified as both.
React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components which present data that changes over time.

Node.js/NPM
Node.js is also very popular due to its large ecosystem of libraries known as NPM modules. NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is the largest software package library in the world, with over 600,000 packages.

React-router-dom
-- link
-- BrowserRouter
-- switch
-- Route

Axios
Axios is a very popular JavaScript library you can use to perform HTTP requests.

Mongoose
Mongoose (web server) Mongoose is a cross-platform embedded web server and networking library with functions including TCP, HTTP client and server, WebSocket client and server, MQTT client and broker and much more. The small size of the software enables any Internet-connected device to function as a web server.


3) A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?


4) Within your own project what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and overcome challenges?
Ans: project management skills


5) Evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were this project, using examples, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature?
