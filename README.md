##Short Answer Questions

1) What are the most important aspects of quality software?


2) What libraries are being used in the app and why?
Many libraries are involved in the creation of this app including React, Node.js, axios, react-router-dom and mongoose.

React
React may be seen as a framework rather than a library, however many have argued that it is qualified as both.
React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components which present data that changes over time.

Node.js/NPM
Node.js is also very popular due to its large ecosystem of libraries known as NPM modules. NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is the largest software package library in the world, with over 600,000 packages.

React-router-dom
-- link
-- BrowserRouter
-- switch
-- Route

Axios
Axios is a very popular JavaScript library you can use to perform HTTP requests.

Mongoose
Mongoose (web server) Mongoose is a cross-platform embedded web server and networking library with functions including TCP, HTTP client and server, WebSocket client and server, MQTT client and broker and much more. The small size of the software enables any Internet-connected device to function as a web server.
